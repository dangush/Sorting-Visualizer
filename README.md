Sorting-Visualizer by Daniel Gushchyan

This project creates a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It is my first attempt at web apps / first time using JS.

This project follow's Clement Mihailescu's tutorial.

Goals:

1. Use this project to learn and develop skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

2. Learn and implemenet new sorting techniques such as Heap Sort and QuickSort, and gain a deeper understanding of sorting techniques I am already familiar with.

3. Use understanding gained from creating this project to create a personal website hosted by GitHub Pages.
